# Python
Hey! My name is Harsh Chauhan and currently pursuing my BTech from SRM University :)


Stepping into my career, I'm eagerly soaking up new knowledge every day. Each challenge I face is a chance to grow, and I love that feeling of learning something fresh. I'm lucky to have mentors guiding me, and I'm excited to see where my hard work and curiosity will take me. (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)

This repository contains all codes that I have written in the process of learning Python :)
